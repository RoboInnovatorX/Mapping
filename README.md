# Mapping
Devices take data from sensors to build a picture of the environment around them and where they are positioned within that environment.

### External sensors
* Camera or Laser scanner

### Internal sensors
* Tires(Wheel Encoder) 
  * There will be black and white strives in the wheels of the Tires.
### Study Cases
* Laser Scanner with SLAM 
* Gmapping

### More Study Cases
* Rotary encoder and how they work?
  * An electro-mechanical device that converts the angular position or motion of a shaft or axle to analog or digital output signals.
  * There are two main types of rotary encoder: absolute and incremental.
  * The output of an absolute encoder indicates the current shaft position, making it an angle transducer.
  * The output of an incremental encoder provides information about the motion of the shaft, which typically is processed elsewhere into information such as position, speed and distance.
